## Kit Assembly

* **Wash your hands first** to discharge static electricity

You should have the following parts:

![alt_text](resources/photos/items.png)

Insert the `8mm Screws` in `Bottom Plate`:

![alt_text](resources/photos/bottom.jpeg)

Place **something rigid** against the back, and flip over.

The screws should stay in place.

Put on **2.5mm Nylon Spacers**.

Insert the `Circuit Board`.

Then the `8mm Metal Spacer`

* **Moderately tighten** with a socket bit if available

* Avoid scratching the PCB or nearby components.

Leave the `Top Plate` off for now.

You can install it after everything is wired up.

## Connection Overview

**8 Channels** are available per module.

* Numbered 1 to 8
* A channel is **considered active** when it is **shorted to ground (GND)**.

Therefore, to wire up a switch, you just need to:

* Connect **one side** to **GND**
* And the **other side** to the **desired channel**

---------

You can make connections via:

* Terminal Block
* 3.5mm Jack
* Pin Headers

## Connection: Terminal Block

Take a look at the `terminal block`:

![alt_text](resources/photos/block.jpeg)

Contains **Channel 1 to 7** and **GND**

To wire up a switch, connect it between a channel and GND.

-------

As an example, here's a simple button with two wires:

![alt_text](resources/photos/push.jpeg)

* When not pushed, the wires are isolated.
* When pushed, they are **connected together**.

Therefore, we just need to attach one wire to GND, and the other to a channel.

* Flip up the lever for GND and the desired channel

* Strip around half inch / 1.2cm of conductor
* Insert into the hole
* Flip lever back down

## Connection: 3.5mm Audio Jack

Two 3.5mm TRS (Tip, Ring, Sleeve) connectors are available.

Sleeve is connected to GND.

Tip and Ring are connected to channels shown below.

## Connection: Pin Headers

All channels are also available on pin headers.

You can install a header or solder wires directly to them.

## Key Test

Use a USB-C cable and connect the module as shown.

* Make sure the `Towards duckyPad` marking faces duckyPad

* The other end is used for daisy-chaining

![alt_text](resources/photos/usbc.png)

Press the `Key Test` script in `Welcome` profile

![alt_text](resources/photos/home.png)

Press a button, the screen should show what is being pressed.

Activate a channel on the expansion module.

The corresponding LED should light up:

![alt_text](resources/photos/led.png)

The screen should respond too:

If so, congrats! The wiring is correct.

## Configurator

You can assign actions to expansion channels just like any other keys.

Module 1 is closest to duckyPad, up to 4 can be daisy-chained.

![alt_text](resources/photos/config.png)

Some notes:

* If using a flip switch, select `Disable Auto-Repeat`.
* So the script doesn't repeat after changing state.

![alt_text](resources/photos/repeat.png)

* Each channel can have different scripts for `onPress` and `onRelease`.
	* `onPress` is when a channel goes from inactive to active
	* `onRelase` is the opposite
